# The final data story

https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/paving-the-road-to-gender-pay-equity/index.html


# Changes made since Part II
Since Part II, I’ve added more data visualizations to better illustrate the pay-productivity gap. I also shared a link in Heinz group chats to crowdsource a word cloud on the first word that comes to mind when thinking about gender equity. Plus, I incorporated a dataset I was working on codifying, which helped me highlight the correlation between the presence of gender equity policies at companies and job satisfaction.

I also updated my call-to-action section by adding a button that directly links to the Level Up Campaign site for the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh. Additionally, I referenced other campaigns advocating for gender equity. Overall, I think the added data visualizations really strengthened the core message of the story.

## The audience
My audience for the final data story is local employers in Pittsburgh, with the goal of encouraging them to resist DEI rollbacks in their industries and instead implement stronger gender equity pay initiatives. To narrow my focus, I also considered insights from research on workplace equity trends such as McKinsey and Company's study to find the association with diversity at companies and their financial metrics (measured through EBIT) discussions on employer attitudes toward DEI efforts (collected through Pew Research studies). Additionally, I shared a link in Heinz group chats to crowdsource a word cloud on the first word that comes to mind when thinking about gender equity.

# Final thoughts
Overall, I wish I had been able to find a way to establish a clear relationship between gender pay equity and a company’s profitability. I spent a lot of time digging for this data, but unfortunately, I couldn’t find accessible sources within my resources or network. It was a frustrating gap, as I believe this connection would have been a powerful addition to my story.

I was also disappointed to see that some organizations, like Equal Pay Today, no longer have active websites—possibly a reflection of the growing pushback against DEI initiatives. Given the current climate, I don’t see this situation improving anytime soon, which makes it even more critical to continue advocating for equity and inclusion. Hopefully, this project can contribute to spreading awareness about the importance of protecting DEI efforts, especially in research and data accessibility.

# Outline
> Include a high-level summary of your project.  This should be a couple paragraphs that describe what you're interested in showing with your final project. 

 **DEI isn’t a problem for corporations, it’s the solution.**


Through these data visualizations, I hope to bring further awareness to corporations to help them hold up a looking glass to examine their own DEI practices. With this, they can be encouraged to be more proactive in these efforts.  In addition, as employers, they will be able to see positive benefits that stem from the implementation of DEI so they understand how it can benefit the company.

This is esoecially relevant for the current times since DEI is being rolled back all across the country, as retail stores like Target and Walmart ar eno longer offering such omissions, along with many other Forbes 500 companies that are no longer ssentially refusing to provide DEI reports, aggregated. There may be a cross indsutry comparison to better scope this scene. 

This will be shown by 
## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# Data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 

US comparison

UK Gender Pay Gap Dataset
 URL: https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/54219db1-dd98-49d9-a383-a5978bb0aeb9/gender-pay-gap
 As provided by the UK's Government Equalities Office, included is mean and median gaps to analyze overall inequality how much top earners contribute to wage disparities. 


UK Employer Profitability Dataset
 URL: https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/03edfeb4-6e37-4afe-b082-f04f9f592c85/profitability_of_uk_companies
 Will compare Poriftiability with Gender Pay Gap disparities and see if there might be any significant correlation, even  though it may not lead to causation. 


Pew Research Center DEI
 URL: https://www.pewresearch.org/dataset/american-trends-panel-wave-121/ 
 Examines how DEI is viewed by employees themselves--can be linked to employe satisfaction/retention at companies. Created Excel file with survey data and will JOIN with employee retention/satisfaction table to compare through pgAdmin4.

See countries in which wage gap is the lowest (Luxembourg) as case study and then find correlations as to how they achieved this.

  Found that they actually conducted a very similar approach by comparing inclusion with financial performance--used EBIT of companies--diversify this
  



# Method and medium

The methodology of this project includes the gathering of data resources that are pubically avaialble which was a difficult process, as some DEI and pay equity information is not accessible to the public. In addition, it is important to consider that some of the dataset information could possibly be skewed such as pay equity reports from companies, as they may choose to self-report and therefore will npt disclose information that may portray their company to be inequitable or favor meant, even though the statistics may be true. Once the data sets are gather that capture the objective target of DEI initiatives and pay equity intiatives at companies, the data must be transferred into data visualizations in which I will be mainly using the Tableau medium with its interactive user-firendly functions, such as the Data Interpreter function that can help clean data if needed, or using the hidden feature to omit any columns that are not relevant to my story. There are also some datasets such as survey information that are sav. files that I will be responsible for converting into an excel file using R Studio commands in order to transfer them to excel and then transfer once again toe xcel. Once all my data visualziations are compiled, I will use SHorthand to effectively tell my story. 

I will also try to join some datasets together using the JOIN command in pgadmin4, such as joining UK companies to profits when analyzing page wage gaps.

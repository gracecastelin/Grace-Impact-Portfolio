| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
Is there anything you find surprising or confusing in the story or data? | Some of the graphs were not the most persusaive. I saw a link but there could be other correlated factors.          |    Surprised that the pay productivity gap increased by that much!         |   Global comparison data was interesting--didn't know gender pay gap differed by that much but maybe include more countries.          |
|    Can you describe what this data is telling you?                    |     I can tell what the story is saying, maybe include more elements to make things stand out                           |  More descriptive labels would make things clearer          |  Focus was a bit everywhere--think a more narrow lens would help           |
|   How effectively do the visuals support the story? How could they be improved, and what would make the story more persuasive?                      |          Definiteley try to hone in on more persuasive impacts to get employers to listen                      |       Include more personal narratives?     |       Make it less wordy--can distract from data      |

Interview answers were collected from students at Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College in MSPPM, MISM, MEIM programs.

|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data visualizations need to be more clear to communicate narrative | I will try to narrow my lens to particular industries, countries, or regional areas so that it won't be overwhelming or too confusing for the reader |
|                                          |                                                                                 |
|  Realized I do begin with a lot of words rather than data visualizations                                        |   Instead of saving all visualizations for the data impact section, I will try to have them more spread out.                                                                              |
|  Some data visualizations are not the most thoroughly drafted--labels can be improved or more descriptive.                                         |                    Will polish my data visualizations created on all platforms.                                                             |
|            |                                                                                 |

I want to ensure my story is communicated effectively so that employers can clearly understand how gender equity contributes to greater business success. To achieve this, I need to create clearer data visualizations with precise graphs and tables, while also enhancing the narrative through a more compelling Shorthand setup.

# About me
My name is Grace Castelin, a MSPPM-D.C. Track Student and I am a bit new to the whole data-design field, and to be frank, I never expected myself to be doing this. However, I am a lover of policy and do see the value of marrying the two disciplines to help larger audiences understand basic phenomena occurring in policy and the real world. 

# What I hope to learn
I want to challenge myself to be a true and effective storyteller with data! I hope to be able to 

- Portray an effective narrative of a social issue I am passionate about, especially within economic equity for marginalized communities. 
- Learn how to create unique graphs and charts.
- Learn how to determine the best data visualization approach to a particular data  set of interest.  
- Learn how to critique different displays of data that may be misrepresentative/misleading to the topic at hand.
